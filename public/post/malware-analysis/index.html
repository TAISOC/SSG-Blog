<h2 id="tai-soc-cybersecurity-spotlight-malware-analysis">Tai SoC Cybersecurity Spotlight: Malware Analysis</h2>
<p>It has been reported that actors working for the Russian government compromised the software supply chain of Solarwinds, an IT enterprise management company. Their goal was to distribute malicious code that would give the actors access to government and corporate networks to steal information.</p>
<p>Malware is at the root of many security breaches. Malware analysis is imperative to help organizations understand the extent of a malware-based attack, as seen in the FireEye example in the preceding paragraph. Malware analysis helps organizations to rapidly identify hosts or systems that might be affected, mitigate the vulnerabilities exploited by malware, and also prevent more compromise.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-malware-analysis">What is Malware Analysis</h2>
<p>Malware analysis is the process of trying to understand the purpose and attributes of a suspicious file or URL. The output of the analysis aids in the detection and mitigation of potential threats. There are several tools and services available that make the process manageable. The process is similar regardless of the platform used:</p>
<ol>
<li>Scanning of the suspicious file or URL against several anti-virus vendors to determine any matches to known malicious signatures.</li>
<li>Running the suspicious file in a sandbox environment to analyze the behavior of the malware. It will aid in detailing the scope and intent of the malware. Examples of output from the analysis include files accessed, outbound connections, tasks created, e.t.c.</li>
<li>Additional manual analysis of the sample through reverse engineering is necessary to obtain information not detected in the previous steps. The process involves working through the obstacles designed by malware creators to disguise the functions and origins of the malware.</li>
</ol>
<p>The reverse engineering process aims to reconstruct the original source code of a particular piece of malware. It enables researchers to understand how the malware works, identify hidden functions such as those that run under specific conditions and even detect cooperation among various known cyber threat actor groups such as the Russian actors in the FireEye example.</p>
<p>Pending a security breach: organizations should consider whether their security teams are well trained and equipped responders who can quickly and effectively perform malware analysis. These resources would help organizations identify whether malware is the root cause of an incident. Failure to have these resources would mean organizations would take longer to contain incidents or completely fail to understand and fully eradicate malware from their networks, resulting in more loss and damage over time.</p>
<h2 id="what-can-organizations-do-if-they-do-not-have-in-house-malware-analysts">What can organizations do if they do not have in-house Malware Analysts?</h2>
<p>Are you confident in your IT team to solve all your security issues? Managed cybersecurity monitoring is a service in which a company outsources the monitoring of threats in their network to a dedicated team of highly trained cybersecurity professionals. When you outsource cybersecurity monitoring from Tai Security Operations Centre (Tai SoC), our team will look at any suspicious activity and determine which level of alert this activity falls in. When we identify a critical problem such as a malware attack, we will open a ticket and work with the organization&rsquo;s team to alleviate the issues. We also follow a predefined escalation path that keeps the appropriate people within the organization informed with what they need to take effective action.</p>
<p>For teams that want to build their in-house capacity, they ideally should not scramble to find and equip malware analysts in the wake of a breach. When malware analysis is already part of a capacity-building program, it helps ensure a more swift and effective response and containment.</p>
<h2 id="tai-soc-malware-analysis-for-incident-handlers-course">Tai SoC Malware Analysis for Incident Handlers Course</h2>
<p>We, Tai SoC Kenya, provide malware analysis training to equip security teams with the knowledge to understand sophisticated malware attacks and strengthen their defenses. The course facilitates a deep understanding of malware: how malware has shaped the global cybersecurity landscape, and the technical skills required to analyze a malware sample. Participants learn various basic techniques to uncover malware features and align the procedures in a forensic investigation process.</p>
